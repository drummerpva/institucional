Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin <br>
literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College <br>
in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through <br>
the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 <br>
and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a <br>
treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", <br>
comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br>
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 <br>
from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from <br>
the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
